this folder (and the classes here) are used to view objects easily in the intrepeter.

PropertiesDisplaySorted - used so that only non-const properties of the object will be displayed.

HiddenMethodsHandle - used so that when pressing TAB, the autocomplete won't complete methods inherited from "handle" class.
