classdef BaseObject < HiddenMethodsHandle & PropertiesDisplaySorted
    %BASEOBJECT an object which has a name
    %   objects of type BaseObject can be identified by their name, so they
    %   would be able to perform well when book-keeping is needed. Because
    %   of that, all the "interesting" classes (like e.g. EventSender or
    %   Savable) derive from BaseObject.
    %   
    %   this class has a static map of BaseObjects that someone thought
    %   they would be nice to have around. Adding an object to this map
    %   would be via calling addBaseObject() --> an Exception will be
    %   thrown if an object is in with the same name.
    %   Removing a BaseObject from the map is done via removeObjIfExists().
    %   Querying (getting) objects from the map is done via 
    %   getObjByName(string), which will return the BaseObject or throw an
    %   exception if no BaseObject was found
    %
    %   This class extends CustomDisplay so that properties could look
    %   better and readable
